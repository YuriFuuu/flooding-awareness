                        <p> Flooding is one of the most devastating natural disasters, affecting countless communities across 
                            the United States. Each year, heavy rains, hurricanes, and rising sea levels result in substantial 
                            financial losses, leaving families struggling to recover from the aftermath. Here we delve into the 
                            influence of flooding on peopleâ€™s lives, highlighting the staggering financial problem incurred by 
                            different states. Beyond the numbers, we aim to share the real stories and feelings of those who 
                            have faced the harsh realities of flooding, illustrating their struggles and resilience. In the 
                            historical overview of significant floods that have shaped the life of our nation, emphasizing the 
                            urgent need for awareness and preparedness in the face of this growing threat.</p>

                    <h2>Financial Losses by States</h2>
                    <article>
                        <p> Based on data from fiscal year 2024, despite flooding impacting the entire nation, we focus on 
                            the ten states with the highest financial losses following these disasters. The bar chart below 
                            highlights the top 10 states with the most significant financial impacts, showing the number of 
                            records for closed losses with payment, closed losses without payment, and open losses (active 
                            claims still unresolved). Texas and Florida lead the list in terms of claims, but notably, Iowa, 
                            with fewer than one-tenth the claims of these states, still ranks 10th in recovery costs.</p>
