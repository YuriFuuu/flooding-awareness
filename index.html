                    <br><h2>The Financial Toll of Flooding</h2><br>
                    <p>
                        Flooding devastates not just homes but also livelihoods. In 2024 alone, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) reported significant claims across the country. The chart below identifies the top 10 states with the highest financial impacts, including open, closed with payment, and closed without payment claims.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">Key Insight:</span> Texas and Florida lead in total claims, but states like Iowa rank surprisingly high in recovery costs despite having fewer claims, illustrating the widespread financial burden of floods.

                        Flooding is often a result of severe storms, which are becoming more frequent and intense. In 2024, Hurricanes Helene and Milton caused widespread flooding and devastation across Florida, highlighting the need for better preparedness.

However, they encountered a sudden surge that rose to four feet, forcing them to swim to safety with their four children. After reaching a friend's house, they returned to rescue their five pets. This terrifying experience led the couple to decide to move inland to avoid future flooding, viewing it as the final push they needed for a change.</p>
