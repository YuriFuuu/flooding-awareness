                        Memories with flooding are always devastating, from property losses 
                        to impact on people's lives. Each year, heavy rains, hurricanes, and 
                        rising sea levels result in substantial financial losses, leaving families 
                        struggling to recover from the aftermath. Both governments and individuals 
                        bear a heavy financial burden because of it.

                        Beyond the numbers, we aim to share the real stories and feelings of those who 
                        have faced the harsh realities of flooding, illustrating their struggles and resilience. 
                        In the historical overview of significant floods that have shaped the life of the 
                        nation, emphasizing the urgent need for awareness and preparedness in the face of 
                        this growing threat.

                        First, let's take a look at the <span class="highlight">financial losses</span> during the floods, as it's one of 
                        the most telling indicators of the severity of floods is the financial loss they 
                        inflict.

                        Below, we explore <span class="highlight">the top 10 states</span> with the most significant financial impacts from 
                        flooding. Based on data from <span class="highlight">fiscal year 2024</span>, while flooding is impacting the entire 
                        nation, the bar chart below emphasizes the top 10 states with the greatest financial 
                        burdens, showing the number of records for <span class="highlight">closed losses with payment</span>, 
                        <span class="highlight">closed losses without payment</span>, and <span class="highlight">open losses</span>

                        Texas and Florida lead the list in terms of claims, but notably, Iowa, with fewer than 
                        one-tenth the claims of these states, still ranks 10th in recovery costs.

                    <p> 
                        Here we delve into the specific financial impacts on individuals and businesses within 
                        these states. The chart below illustrates detailing <span class="highlight">loss payments</span> categorized 
                        by different <span class="highlight">occupancy</span> and <span class="highlight">business groups</span>.

                        separating it into <span class="highlight">building coverage</span>, <span class="highlight">content coverage</span>, and both categories. 
                        By examining these factors, we gain insight into not only the magnitude of financial losses 
                        but also how well residents and businesses are protected against the aftermath of flooding.

                        This data serves as a crucial reminder of the need for comprehensive <span class="highlight">insurance policies</span> 
                        and <span class="highlight">proactive measures</span> to mitigate the financial burdens that come with flooding. 
                        Understanding these individual loss payments and coverage details helps inform future policies and preparedness

                        As flooding poses significant challenges across the U.S., it's crucial to recognize that many of these floods 
                        are triggered by severe weather events, especially <span class="highlight">hurricanes</span>, which bring 
                        destructive winds and torrential rain.

                        impacting the region as a powerful Category 4 storm. Following this, on October 9, <span class="highlight">Hurricane Milton</span> 
                        struck Florida as a Category 3 storm. Both hurricanes caused widespread damage and significant flooding

However, they encountered a sudden surge that rose to four feet, forcing them to swim to safety with their four children. After reaching a friend's house, they returned to rescue their five pets. This terrifying experience led the couple to decide to move inland to avoid future flooding, viewing it as the final push they needed for a change.</p>
